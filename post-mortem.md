## Approach and Process
What in our process and approach to this project would we do differently next time?
## What we would do differently

* Could have planned out wireframe better even though we did the ERD from the restaurant
* Gantt Chart for proper planning of functions and files in case other parts depend on it
* Spend less time on ideation and more time on planning the features and functionality of the app(WE SPENT 2 DAYS)

##
What in our process and approach to this project went well that we would repeat next time?

##What Went Well

* Consistent and constant communication
* git merges were done together so conflicts of files can be resolved on the spot
* Issuing ownership over entire parts of the project
  * Clear picture of what needs to be done for each part
* giving input to each other and sharing feedback actually helped with the solving of some coding bugs

Code and Code Design

##
What in our code and program design in the project would we do differently next time?

* Better Design layout for the app
* ERD planning - we took a lot of time planning the tables and making adjustments
* Plan further features earlier, rather than add-on more later.
* scaffolding might be a good starting point but its also a double edged sword as we are not very familiar with what exactly it documents

##
What in our code and program design in the project went well? Is there anything we would do the same next time?

* routing and nested routing went pretty well
* pretty clear on the functionality of the app
*

WDI Unit 3 Post Mortem (individual)
##
What habits did I use during this unit that helped me?

## Brandon
* actually realising that alot of rails are method calls
* MVC => model >>> controller >>> views understanding
* Sifting through Stackoverflow


## Siew Ling
* attempting the furthers as much as possible in the assignments
* reading rails documentations
* googling

## Yi Jin

* modifying from gitbook examples

##
What habits did I have during this unit that I can improve on?

## Brandon
* Understanding what rails is actually doing in relation to JS
* the reversing of method calls through model declarations

## Siew Ling
* Not having proper rest and lost of focus

## Yi Jin
* Reading team mates codes

##
How is the overall level of the course during this unit? (instruction, course materials, etc.)

## Yi Jin
* 5/5
* Lessons did not include partials for search function(I needed it)

##Siew Ling
* Some gitbook examples are confusing as steps are being skipped

##Brandon

* Rails to JS relationship is tough
* SYNTAX and naming restrictions literally breaks my code
